## Required Images

Add your images here with these exact names:

1. **logo.png**
   - Logo for the navigation bar
   - Recommended size: 150x50px or similar aspect ratio

   - Banner image for the home page
   - Recommended size: 1920x600px or similar aspect ratio
   - Location: `/public/images/banner.png`

## How to Add Images

1. Copy your logo image file
2. Paste it into this folder (`public/images/`)
3. Rename it to `logo.jpeg` (or `logo.jpg` if using that extension)

4. Copy your banner image file
5. Paste it into this folder (`public/images/`)
6. Rename it to `banner.jpeg` (or `banner.jpg` if using that extension)

## Supported Formats

- JPEG (.jpeg, .jpg)
- PNG (.png)
- SVG (.svg) - for logo only

## Notes

- File names are case-sensitive: `logo.jpeg` not `Logo.jpeg`
- The application will show fallback designs if images are not found
- After adding images, restart your development server to see them
